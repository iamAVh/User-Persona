# 🧠 Reddit User Persona Generator

This project generates **realistic and structured user personas** based on a Reddit user’s public activity (comments + posts). It uses **LLM-based summarization** and NLP rule-based heuristics to extract personality, behavior, interests, profession, and more.

Ideal for:
- UX research
- Marketing personas
- LLM fine-tuning or prompt seeding
- Behavioral profiling (educational/experimental use)

## 🚀 Features

✅ Scrapes up to 100 comments & 50 posts from a given Reddit username  
✅ Summarizes user content using Hugging Face’s `bart-large-cnn-samsum` model  
✅ Extracts traits like interests, personality, behavior, profession, location  
✅ Generates professional third-person user persona in text format  
✅ Outputs formatted text resembling real marketing/user profiles  
✅ Handles token size issues with safe chunking  
✅ Fully modular & extendable design

## 🤖 LLM Model Used

- **Model**: [`philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum`](https://huggingface.co/philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum)  
- **Type**: Transformer-based summarizer (BART architecture)  
- **Token Limit**: 1024  
- **Chunking Logic**: Each text chunk is limited to **≤400 tokens** to avoid overflow

This model was chosen for its strength in conversational and dialogue summarization — great for summarizing Reddit content.

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. **Input**
Provide a Reddit profile URL (e.g., `https://www.reddit.com/user/spez/`) via command line.

### 2. **Reddit Scraping**
- Uses PRAW to extract:
  - 100 latest comments
  - 50 latest posts

### 3. **Preprocessing & Chunking**
- Texts are combined and chunked using tokenizer-aware splitting.
- Each chunk contains ≤400 tokens to prevent model overflow.

### 4. **Summarization**
- Each chunk is summarized using `philschmid/bart-large-cnn-samsum`
- Final persona summary is generated by re-summarizing all chunk summaries.

### 5. **Trait Extraction**
Using rule-based NLP and regex:
- **Interests**: Keywords like `gaming`, `music`, `fitness`, etc.
- **Profession**: Matches words like `student`, `developer`, `engineer`, etc.
- **Location**: Regex like `from X`, `based in Y`
- **Personality**: Adjectives like `introvert`, `funny`, etc.
- **Behavior**: Matches emotional or expressive language
